Sorting utility based on the SAT solver Kissat used in a demo
presented in the talk "Fueling the SAT Revolution" of the seminar 

   Verified software: tools and experiments
   https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/vsow04

at the Isaac Newton Institute in June 2021.

Install and compile 'kissat' in '../kissat' and run 'make'.

To sort run for instance

   shuf organizers | ./satsort

You can also generate CNF in DIMACS format instead and feed
it into for instance 'kissat' directly

   shuf organizers | ./satsort -d | kissat

but this will not allow you to get back the sorted input.
