Sorting utility using the SAT solver Kissat used in a demo
of

Install and compile 'kissat' in '../kissat' and run 'make'.

To sort run for instance

   shuf organizers | ./satsort

You can also generate CNF in DIMACS format instead and feed
it into for instance 'kissat' directly

   shuf organizers | ./satsort -d | kissat

but this will not allow you to get back the sorted input.
